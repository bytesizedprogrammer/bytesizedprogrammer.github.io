                <b>Instructions below on how to run, as it will not be explained here.  This project is a project that you run locally on your computer. </b>
              </p>

              <p>
                The way this project functions is quite simple, but a long process.  It starts with SlippC, a program created by a group of 5 developers that converts a singular slp file to JSON.  What we did is we took this script and automated it to the take all the slp files in a folder and run the command on all of them.  After completion of converting each slp file to JSON, it then automatically deletes all of the slp files you converted.  Afterwards, we made another python script that takes said JSON files, and extracts the data we want and sends them up to the MySQL database assuming they fit the criteria expected.  What I mean is it looks at each JSON file one at a time, and checks for certain criteria like if the player is on a ban list of players you don't want the matches to count for, if the match was long enough, if the match was completed, etc. and if valid, it then sends the right info up to the database.  That's how we achieve the dataset that will come in handy later.  It then goes to Slippi-JS, an application developed by Project Slippi that fetches tons of real-time data from your game of SSBM <!--, such as: Stock (Life) count per player, damage per player, each character, the stage, and even advanced things like: number of edgeguards, number of neutral -> punish conversions (AKA the number of times you hit your opponent with one hit and was able to successfully convert it into a combo), etc-->.   We took this project (Slippi-JS) and modified it to take note of additional details to prepare it for sending data through websocket to the python server.  We did this through various actions such as making the data given through the program to be more easily understandable to the server (such as submitting character names and the stage name instead of ids as this way it is primed for the SQL command), making it understand which player is which, restrictng the amount of times data is sent (as to avoid server overload/data being sent too often and breaking/making the program borderline useless), etc.  Afterwards, we addressed the python server, also the file where the ML is run.  We first setup the Websocket to take in the data that Slippi-JS was sending so we can receive real time data.  After receiving it, we took the data of opponent character and stage and ran the SQL query <b>SELECT * FROM training_data WHERE character_opp = ? AND stage = ? </b> that way we can receive previous match history from the database that we created earlier.  What we did next was setup the ML model, and had it get trained off of the database data.  We set it up so that 80% of the data would be utilized for training, and the other 20% would be used for testing.  We then have the whole ML process restart until the accuracy rate is at least 80%, and then the project is mostly complete.  The final step is that the chances of you winning updates about every 8 seconds until the game ends, so we had the ML run with the updated numbers obtain throughout the match so you can see the chances change throughout the whole match.
              </p>

              <!--
              
              This project operates in a straightforward yet lengthy process. It begins with SlippC, a tool developed by a team of five that converts individual `.slp` files into JSON format. We automated this process by creating a script that converts all `.slp` files in a folder to JSON in one go, and then deletes the original `.slp` files after conversion.

              Next, we developed a Python script to process the JSON files. This script extracts the required data and uploads it to a MySQL database, provided it meets certain criteria. Specifically, it reviews each JSON file to check for conditions like whether a player is on a ban list, if the match duration is adequate, and if the match was completed. Valid data is then sent to the database to build a useful dataset.

              Following this, we worked with Slippi-JS, a tool from Project Slippi that gathers real-time data from Super Smash Bros. Melee (SSBM) games. We modified Slippi-JS to capture additional details and transmit them via WebSocket to our Python server. Changes included formatting the data to be more server-friendly (e.g., using character and stage names instead of IDs) and regulating the frequency of data transmission to prevent server overload.

              On the Python server side, which also runs the machine learning (ML) model, we set up the WebSocket to receive real-time data from Slippi-JS. The server then queries the database to fetch previous match data based on the opponent's character and stage. We configured the ML model to train on 80% of the database data and test on the remaining 20%. The training process is iterated until the model achieves at least 80% accuracy.

              Finally, during gameplay, the ML model updates the probability of winning approximately every 8 seconds. These updates are displayed throughout the match, reflecting the latest data and adjustments made by the model.

                <li>    Created a real-time match prediction system using historical and live data combined with a machine learning logistic regression algorithm while constantly updating throughout the match (It restarts automatically until it has an accuracy rate of at least 80%)                </li>
                <li>      Created a python script that a user can run that automates entering match data automatically into the MySQL dataset with advanced cusotomizable filtering options of their choosing (Match Length, If opponent is someone they know, Stage, etc.)                </li>
